 * Maps between Activity instances and user-defined keys. Can be used to
 * maintain and schedule Activity instances through a layer of indirection.
 * 
 * For example, an Activity could be stored in the map using the method
 * call put("activity", activityRef). The Activity pointed to by activityRef
 * could then be subsequently scheduled using the method call 
 * scheduleNow("activity"). Furthermore, the Activity referred to by the
 * key "activity" could be changed later by another call to put(), changing
 * a visualization's behavior without modifying any other application code.
