The layout package contains a library of useful layout algorithms for use by
prefuse visualizations. All provided layouts descend from either the Layout
or TreeLayout classes, allowing the layout bounds, anchor point, and root node
to be set, overriding any default behaviors. This facilitates the use of multiple
layouts within a single visualization (e.g., applying a different layout
algorithm to a specific subtree in a tree visualization).
