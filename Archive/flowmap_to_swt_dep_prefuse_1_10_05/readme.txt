prefuse README

--INTRO--

prefuse is a toolkit for creating highly-interactive visualizations of data
sets. Examples of data supported by prefuse include hierarchies (organization
charts, taxonomies, file systems), networks (computer networks, social networks,
web site linkage) and unstructured collections of data (timelines, scatterplots).
Using this toolkit, developers can create responsive, animated graphical 
interfaces for visualizing, exploring, and manipulating these various forms of data.

--REQUIREMENTS--

prefuse is written in Java 1.4, using the Java2D graphics library. To compile the
prefuse code, and to build and run prefuse applications, you'll need this version
of Java or later. You can download it from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

--BUILDING--

prefuse uses the Ant system from the Apache Group to compile the files. Ant is bundled
with this distribution, and can be run using the "build.bat" script (in Windows) or
the "build.sh" script (in UNIX). For example, running "build.bat usage" will provide
a list of available commands and running "build.bat api" will generate the html
API documentation for the toolkit.

--MORE--

Documentation is a bit sparse right now, as this is only the alpha release. We
apologize for this, but check http://prefuse.sourceforge.net for more info as
it becomes available.
