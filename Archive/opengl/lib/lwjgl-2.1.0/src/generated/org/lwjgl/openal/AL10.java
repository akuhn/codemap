	 * This is because in many cases error checking would adversely impact the

	 * <p>
	 * Each detectable error is assigned a numeric
	 * code. When an error is detected by AL, a flag is set and the error code is recorded.
	 * Further errors, if they occur, do not affect this recorded code. When GetError is
	 * called, the code is returned and the flag is cleared, so that a further error will again
	 * record its code. If a call to GetError returns AL_NO_ERROR then there has been no
	 * detectable error since the last call to GetError (or since the AL was initialized).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Error codes can be mapped to strings. The GetString function returns a pointer to a
	 * constant (literal) string that is identical to the identifier used for the enumeration
	 * value, as defined in the specification.

	 * AL_INVALID_OPERATION - Illegal call.<br>
	 * AL_OUT_OF_MEMORY - Unable to allocate memory.<br>
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The table summarizes the AL errors. Currently, when an error flag is set, results of
	 * AL operations are undefined only if AL_OUT_OF_MEMORY has occured. In other
	 * cases, the command generating the error is ignored so that it has no effect on AL
	 * state or output buffer contents. If the error generating command returns a value, it
	 * returns zero. If the generating command modifies values through a pointer
	 * argument, no change is made to these values. These error semantics apply only to
	 * AL errors, not to system errors such as memory access errors.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Several error generation conditions are implicit in the description of the various AL
	 * commands. First, if a command that requires an enumerated value is passed a value
	 * that is not one of those specified as allowable for that command, the error
	 * AL_INVALID_ENUM results. This is the case even if the argument is a pointer to a
	 * symbolic constant if that value is not allowable for the given command. This will
	 * occur whether the value is allowable for other functions, or an invalid integer value.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Integer parameters that are used as names for AL objects such as Buffers and
	 * Sources are checked for validity. If an invalid name parameter is specified in an AL
	 * command, an AL_INVALID_NAME error will be generated, and the command is
	 * ignored.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If a negative integer is provided where an argument of type sizei is specified, the
	 * error AL_INVALID_VALUE results. The same error will result from attempts to set
	 * integral and floating point values for attributes exceeding the legal range for these.
	 * The specification does not guarantee that the implementation emits
	 * AL_INVALID_VALUE if a NaN or Infinity value is passed in for a float or double
	 * argument (as the specification does not enforce possibly expensive testing of
	 * floating point values).
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Commands can be invalid. For example, certain commands might not be applicable
	 * to a given object. There are also illegal combinations of tokens and values as
	 * arguments to a command. AL responds to any such illegal command with an
	 * AL_INVALID_OPERATION error.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If memory is exhausted as a side effect of the execution of an AL command, either
	 * on system level or by exhausting the allocated resources at AL's internal disposal,
	 * the error AL_OUT_OF_MEMORY may be generated. This can also happen independent
	 * of recent commands if AL has to request memory for an internal task and fails to
	 * allocate the required memory from the operating system.
