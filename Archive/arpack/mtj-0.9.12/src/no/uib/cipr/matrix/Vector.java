/**
 * Basic vector interface. It holds <code>double</code>s in an array, and is
 * used alongside <code>Matrix</code> in numerical computations. Implementing
 * classes decides on the actual storage.
 * 
 * <h4>Basic operations</h4>
 * <p>
 * Use <code>size</code> to get the vector size. <code>get(int)</code> gets
 * an element, and there are corresponding <code>set(int,double)</code> and
 * <code>add(int,double)</code> methods as well. Note that vector indices are
 * zero-based (typical for Java and C). This means that they range from 0 to
 * <code>size-1</code>. It is legal to have <code>size</code> equal zero.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Other basic operations are <code>zero</code> which zeros all the entries of
 * the vector, which can be cheaper than either zeroing the vector manually, or
 * creating a new vector, and the operation <code>copy</code> which creates a
 * deep copy of the vector. This copy has separate storage, but starts with the
 * same contents as the current vector.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Iterators</h4>
 * <p>
 * The vector interface extends <code>Iterable</code>, and the iterator
 * returns a <code>VectorEntry</code> which contains current index and entry
 * value. Note that the iterator may skip non-zero entries. Using an iterator,
 * many simple and efficient algorithms can be created. The iterator also
 * permits changing values in the vector, however only non-zero entries can be
 * changed.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Basic linear algebra</h4>
 * <p>
 * A selection of basic linear algebra operations are available. To ensure high
 * efficiency, little or no internal memory allocation is done, and the user is
 * required to supply the output arguments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The operations available include:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><i>Additions</i></dt>
 * <dd>Vectors can be added to each other, even if their underlying vector
 * structures are incompatible</dd>
 * <dt><i>Scaling</i></dt>
 * <dd>Scalar multiplication (scaling) of a whole vector</dd>
 * <dt><i>Norms</i></dt>
 * <dd>Both innerproducts and norms can be computed. Several common norms are
 * supported</dd>
 * </dl>
