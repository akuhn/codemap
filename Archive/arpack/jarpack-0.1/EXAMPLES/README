ARPACK EXAMPLES
---------------

First, read the original ARPACK Examples README in README.orig.

The examples have been built and stored as jar files to avoid
some name collisions between different class files used for
different tests.

Also note that some of the original tests were not translated
because they use complex numbers, which are currently not
supported by f2j.

Each subdirectory has a script to run all the examples.  For
example, the BAND directory contains a script runtest_band.sh
which runs all the BAND examples.

  # cd BAND
  # ./runtest_band.sh
