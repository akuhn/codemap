JARPACK 0.1 Installation

All you need to do to get started with JARPACK is set your CLASSPATH.

The following directions are for Solaris (using csh).  Other UNIX platforms 
should be very similar.  MS-DOS and Windows users should consult their JDK
documentation to find out how to set the CLASSPATH.

If your CLASSPATH environment variable is already set, append the following
file to it:

  $JARPACK_HOME/arpack_combined.jar

where JARPACK_HOME represents the full path of the directory where you have
JARPACK installed.

Alternately, you may individually append the following jar files.  This may
be preferable when you want to use the full BLAS/LAPACK jar files from the
JLAPACK distribution (the ones here are subsets).

  $JARPACK_HOME/f2jutil.jar
  $JARPACK_HOME/blas.jar
  $JARPACK_HOME/lapack.jar
  $JARPACK_HOME/xerbla.jar
  $JARPACK_HOME/arpack.jar
  $JARPACK_HOME/arpack_util.jar

For example, if your JARPACK directory is /users/bob/JARPACK/ the following
command would append the appropriate files to your CLASSPATH:
  
  % setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH":/users/bob/JARPACK/f2jutil.jar:/users/bob/JARPACK/blas.jar:/users/bob/JARPACK/lapack.jar:/users/bob/JARPACK/xerbla.jar:/users/bob/JARPACK/arpack.jar:/users/bob/JARPACK/arpack_util.jar"

There are several basic test files in the $JARPACK_HOME/EXAMPLES subdirectory.
