/**
 * Static helper methods for dealing with the Java Native Interface and detection of
 * operating systems and architectures. The main purpose of this class is to provide a
 * more portable alternative to the System.loadLibrary method (and horrible syntax of
 * Bundle-NativeCode in MANIFEST files) when bundling binaries as part of a jar (either
 * inside, or in a directory structure nearby).
 * <p>
 * Note on usage: unfortunately it is not possible to provide a loadLibrary(String) method
 * here as it needs to know the calling class, which is lost when wrapped here. To load a
 * native library using this class, call the getPortableLibraryName() method to return a
 * String which may then be passed to System.loadLibrary().
 * <p>
 * Note: due to the nature of this class, a portable JUnit TestCase is not possible.
