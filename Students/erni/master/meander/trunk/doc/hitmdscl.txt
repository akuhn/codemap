Dear Adrian,

thanks for Your interest in hitmds2.
Sorry, the documentation is indeed very poor.

First of all, an ascii (white-space-separated)
data matrix or distance matrix is assumed to be read from
standard input via 'cat myfile | hitmds2 x y z v' or 'hitmds x y z v < myfile'

x is number of cycles, i.e. sweeps through complete data set, usually 50 <= x < 1000
y is the learning rate between 10 and .01, try .1 first,
z is zero
v is the metric selector, namely
0: Standard Euclidean distance -> improved (nonlinear) PCA-like visualization
1: 1-Pearson Correlation; '1:n' means (1-Pearson Correlation)^n
2: Spearman rank correlation, only valid after transforming data to ranks (torank.awk)
':n' General Minkowski metrics, e.g. 2:Eucl.Dist, 1:Manhattan.Dist, etc

The first line of the text input matrix contains to ascii integer numbers
the number samples (i.e. following number of lines = data vectors) and
the input dimension

After the data matrix, there is another number indicating the target
dimension, e.g. 2. A negative sign here denotes random initialization,
the standard case.


If Your matrix is already a dissimilarity or distance matrix, then the
number of lines given in the first row must possess a negative sign.

Hope that these information helps to interpret the makefile examples
and to run hitmds for Your purpose. The ZIP code map of Switzerland
should be feasable.

If not, let me know. If You are successful You might want to share
this by just letting me know.

Best
Marc
