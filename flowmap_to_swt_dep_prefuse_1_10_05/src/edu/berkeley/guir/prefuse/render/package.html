The render package contains interfaces and modules for rendering VisualItems
into a graphics context. Renderer instances are responsible for drawing items, 
computing item bounds, and determining if a point lies within or without an item.
RendererFactory instances, on the other hand, are used to determine which
Renderer should be used for a given VisualItem.
