	abstract = {The purpose of object matching is to decide the similarity between two objects. This paper introduces 24 possible distance measures based on the Hausdorff distance between two point sets. These measures can be used to match two sets of edge points extracted from any two objects. Based on experiments on synthetic images containing various levels of noise, the authors determined that one of these distance measures, called the modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) has the best performance for object matching. The advantages of MHD ever other distances are also demonstrated on several edge snaps of objects extracted from real images},

  Abstract     = {Understanding classes and methods is a key activity
                  in object-oriented programming, since classes
                  represent the primary abstractions from which
                  applications are built, while methods contain the
                  actual program logic. The main problem of this task
                  is to quickly grasp the purpose and inner structure
                  of a class. To achieve this goal, one must be able
                  to overview multiple methods at once. In this paper,
                  we present microprints, pixel-based representations
                  of methods enriched with semantical information. We
                  present three specialized microprints each dealing
                  with a specific aspect we want to understand of
                  methods: (1) state access, (2) control flow, and (3)
                  invocation relationship.},
